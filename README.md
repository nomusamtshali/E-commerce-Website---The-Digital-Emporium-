# [JSF03] Project: Vue Challenge

## Project Overview

In this project, I was tasked with refactoring an existing React-based e-commerce website into a Vue.js application. The goal was to create a fully functional e-commerce store using Vue.js, Vue Router, and Tailwind CSS, while fetching data from the Fake Store API. This project allowed me to demonstrate my understanding of Vue.js and its ecosystem, as well as my ability to refactor existing code into a new framework.

## Project Brief 

1. Study and understand the Vue e-commerce store rubric provided in your student sheet.

2. Have a look at the model e-commerce store provided in React: https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/jsf-react-ecommerce.

3. Study the Fake Store API and see what endpoints you will need to fetch different pieces of data from.

4. Code your solution in Vue and document your code with JSDoc.

5. Commit changes to your Github repository (remember the naming convention: Module_4_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF03)

6. Add a README.md file with the project info, how to set it up, technologies used and other information specified in the rubric

7. Test your application for any bugs and improvements.

8. Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote GitHub repository

9. Submit the GitHub Repository Link to the LMS JSF03 Submission Project Tab.

## Technologies Used

* **Vue.js**: A progressive and flexible JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue.js allows for a robust and maintainable codebase, making it ideal for complex applications.
* **Vue Router**: The official router for Vue.js, providing a robust and flexible way to manage client-side routing. Vue Router allows for seamless navigation between routes, making it easy to create complex applications.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization of web applications. Tailwind CSS provides a set of pre-defined classes that can be used to style HTML elements, making it easy to create consistent and visually appealing designs.
* **Fake Store API**: A RESTful API providing a set of endpoints for fetching e-commerce data, such as products, categories, and reviews. The Fake Store API allows for easy integration with front-end applications, making it ideal for prototyping and testing.

## Set Up Instructions 

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone .
2. Open the project: Open the project folder in your preferred code editor or IDE.
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the project.
5. Follow the localhost link and open your web browser

## Usage Examples

- Browse products: You can navigate to the application's homepage to browse available products.
- View product details: You can click on a product to view its details, including price, description, and reviews.
- Filter categories: You can filter through the different categories in the dropdown.
- Sort products: You can sort the product's prices from low to high, high to low or set it to default.

## Reflections 

### Areas of Mastery 

One area where I felt particularly confident was implementing code into the script and template tags. I was able to successfully refactor the React-based code into Vue.js, using the script tag to define the component's logic and the template tag to define the component's HTML structure. This allowed me to create a seamless and interactive user experience.

### Challenges faced

One of the biggest challenges I faced was importing my components correctly. Initially, only the header component was appearing on my web browser, while the other components were not rendering. After some debugging, I realized that I had to adjust the way I was importing my components, using the correct syntax and file paths. Additionally, I struggled with routing in Vue.js, as it differs from React. However, after consulting the documentation and seeking help from resources, I was able to successfully implement routing in my application.

### Areas of Improvement 

One area where I would like to improve is in optimizing the performance of my application. While the application is functional, I believe there are opportunities to improve its speed and responsiveness. I would like to explore techniques such as code splitting, lazy loading, and caching to improve the overall performance of the application.

## Overall Learning Experience 

This project was an excellent learning experience, allowing me to deepen my understanding of Vue.js and its ecosystem. I was able to successfully refactor an existing React-based application into a Vue.js application, demonstrating my ability to adapt to new frameworks and technologies. I also gained valuable experience with Vue Router, Tailwind CSS, and the Fake Store API, which will be useful in future projects. Overall, I am proud of what I accomplished and look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a developer.
